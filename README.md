### ABOUT
Virality is a browser-based tool for editing and exporting audio with the **slowed + reverb** and **nightcore** effects. No installs, no fees, just drag a file in and start tweaking.

*  Preview audio instantly in the browser
*  Adjust speed, reverb mix, and reverb decay live
*  Apply built-in presets (Default, Slowed + Reverb, Nightcore) or create your own
*  Export to WAV or MP3 (single file or batch ZIP)
*  Custom waveform visualization with scrubbing

### WHY DID YOU MAKE THIS ???
I got tired of sites that paywalled the basic feature of batch downloading more than 1 file. I wanted a simple, self-contained tool that didn’t require DAWs, plug-ins, or sketchy mobile apps. I’m a designer first, but I love music production and often experiment with slowed/nightcore edits. This project gave me a way to combine design + coding into something I can actually use.
